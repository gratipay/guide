# Governance

Open organizations are best understood as a commons, and *Governing the Commons* by Elinor Ostrom is the best resource for guidance on, well, governing a commons. :)

The tl;dr is that every situation is different, and there are no one-size-fits all solutions. If you want to do it right you need to read her book and do the hard work of applying it to your situation. That said, she does distill [eight key factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#Design_principles_for_Common_Pool_Resource_.28CPR.29_institutions) in successfully managed commons:

 1. Clearly defined boundaries (clear definition of the contents of the common pool resource and effective exclusion of external un-entitled parties);
 1. Rules regarding the appropriation and provision of common resources that are adapted to local conditions;
 1. Collective-choice arrangements that allow most resource appropriators to participate in the decision-making process;
 1. Effective monitoring by monitors who are part of or accountable to the appropriators;
 1. A scale of graduated sanctions for resource appropriators who violate community rules;
 1. Mechanisms of conflict resolution that are cheap and of easy access;
 1. Self-determination of the community recognized by higher-level authorities; and
 1. In the case of larger common-pool resources, organization in the form of multiple layers of nested enterprises, with small local CPRs at the base level.

## Legal Structure

You can be a for-profit or a non-profit or a department of government. A for-profit is owned by  
private parties (individuals or other organizations). A non-profit or a department of government is owned by everyone and therefore no-one.

## Management Structure

While legal structure relates to ownership, management structure relates to how power is distributed within the organization.

Different models, dictatorship to democracy. Cooperatives, non-profits, for-profits. B Corps, PBCs. Government?

Who is in and who is out?

Ownership at the legal level and ownership at the supra-legal level.
