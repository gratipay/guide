# The Gratipay Guide to Running an Open Organization

The purpose of this book is to share best practices for running an open organization. Gratipay is itself an open organization; we provide payments and payroll services for other open organizations. We see a need in our user community for practical advice on running an open organization, both because the concept itself is new and also because many of us are new to organizational leadership in general. The audience for this book, therefore, is the community of open organizations that are using Gratipay, as well as our potential users.

Open organizations are fundamentally *organizations*, a term we use loosely to mean an economic unit larger than an individual. Whether business, charity, or government, organizations take in money, and produce value in the world. A good deal of advice, then, about running *any* organization, applies to running an open organization.

However, a lot of our users aren't used to thinking of themselves as organizational leaders. Some might balk at the idea—maybe it even sounds like selling out! If this describes you, then part of the purpose of this book is to put you on a path to thinking about your project as an *organization* and you as a *leader* of it (or to help you decide that Gratipay is not a good fit for you).

This book is laid out as an introduction to topics that are relevant to every organization. Each chapter provides a brief introduction to the topic with links to further resources, and then a discussion of unique ways in which the topic applies to *open* organizations.

Before we get into practical matters, though, let's take a moment to define what exactly we mean by an open organization, and, along the way, why you might want to run one.


## What Is an Open Organization? Why Are They Interesting?

Let's start by defining what we mean when we talk about open organizations. There may be other definitions, but this is Gratipay's. We'll look first at a snapshot, our definition as it currently stands. Then we'll provide some background on how we arrived at our definition. Along the way, hopefully you'll catch some of our excitement about how open organizations improve on closed organizations.

(Note: This section is especially important for us internally, because it encodes one of the two criteria we look at when [reviewing](http://inside.gratipay.com/howto/review-teams) applications for new organizations interested in joining Gratipay.)


### Our Definition

There are three primary characteristics we look for in an open organization: liberal licensing, pay-what-you-want revenue, and take-what-you-want compensation. For each of these criteria, there is room for interpretation. We're fundamentally looking for an *attitude* of openness, of which these characteristics are a manifestation. Let's consider each in turn.

Liberal licensing means that your organization offers its products and services under permissive licenses such as those developed by [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/), or those approved by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/). Why? Because you want to share!

**TODO** What about services instead of products?

Pay-what-you-want revenue means that a portion of your revenue is voluntary on the part of your customers. We said earlier that organizations in general take in money, and produce value in the world. There's a sense in which *open* organizations reverse the process: first we produce value in the world, and *then* we receive money for it. Why? Because you want to share!

Take-what-you-want compensation means the staff of the organization—its proprietors, employees, contractors, etc.—directly determine their own compensation. No-one decides anyone else's salary, whether through performance reviews or other algorithmic determinations. Why? Because sharing is great! :-)
