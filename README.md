# The Gratipay Guide to Running an Open Organization

The purpose of this book is to share best practices for running an open organization. It is written and published by Gratipay, which is itself an open organization. We provide payment and payroll services for open organizations. Since the concept of an open organization is so new, we perceive a need in our community for practical advice on running an open organization. The audience for this book, therefore, is the community of open organizations that are using Gratipay, as well as our potential users.

Before we get into practical matters, though, let's take a moment to define what exactly we mean by an open organization, and why you might want to run one.

## What is an Open Organization?

Let's start by defining what we mean when we talk about open organizations. There may be other definitions, but this is Gratipay's. We'll look first at a snapshot, our definition of an open organization as it currently stands. Then we'll provide some background on how we arrived at this definition.

### Our Definition

There are three characteristics we look for in an open organization: liberal licensing, pay-what-you-want revenue, and take-what-you-want compensation.

Liberal licensing means that your organization offers its products and services under liberal licenses such as those developed by [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) or approved by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/).
