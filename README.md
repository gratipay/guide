# The Gratipay Guide to Launching an Open Organization

The purpose of this book is to help you launch an open organization on Gratipay. Gratipay is itself an open organization; we provide payments and payroll services for other open organizations. We see a need in our user community for practical advice on getting an open organization off the ground, both because the concept itself is new, and also because many of us who care about openness are new to organizational leadership. The audience for this book, therefore, is the community of people who are using Gratipay for their open organization—especially those just starting out—as well as our potential customers.

The important thing to remember about an open organization is that it is still an *organization*, a term we'll use to mean an economic unit larger than an individual. Whether business, charity, or government, organizations take in money, and produce value in the world. Open organizations are no different in that regard, and they are subject to the same market and regulatory forces as any other organization. They have to tell a better story about a better product for a better price in order to succeed, and therefore much of the advice that applies to *any* organization translates more or less directly to an open organization.

However, a lot of us aren't used to thinking of themselves as organizational leaders. Some of you might balk at the idea—maybe it even sounds like selling out! If you're raising your hand, then part of the purpose of this book is to put you on a path to thinking about your project as an *organization* and you as a *leader* of it. Hopefully, after reading, this will sound more exciting than scary.

This book is laid out as an introduction to topics that are relevant to every organization. Each chapter provides a brief introduction to the topic with links to further resources, and includes a discussion of ways in which the topic uniquely applies to *open* organizations.

Before we proceed, though, let's take a moment to define what exactly we mean by an open organization, and (for those not already convinced) why you might want to launch one.


## What Is an Open Organization? Why Are They Interesting?

Let's start by defining what we mean when we talk about open organizations. We'll look first at a snapshot, our definition as it currently stands. Then we'll provide some background on how we arrived at our definition. Along the way, hopefully you'll catch some of our excitement about how open organizations improve on closed organizations. Lastly, we'll discuss our definition in relation to some other definitions.

(Note: This section is especially important for Gratipay internally, because it encodes one of the two criteria we look at when [reviewing](http://inside.gratipay.com/howto/review-teams) applications for new organizations interested in joining Gratipay.)


### Our Definition

There are three primary characteristics we look for in an open organization: liberal licensing, pay-what-you-want revenue, and take-what-you-want compensation. For each of these criteria, there is room for interpretation. We're fundamentally looking for an *attitude* of openness, of which these characteristics are a manifestation. Let's consider each in turn.

Liberal licensing means that your organization offers its products and services under permissive licenses such as those developed by [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/), or those approved by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/). Why? Because you want to share! P.S. We haven't sort out how this relates to services businesses yet.

Pay-what-you-want revenue means that a portion of your revenue is voluntary on the part of your customers. We said earlier that organizations in general take in money, and produce value in the world. There's a sense in which *open* organizations reverse the process: first we produce value in the world, and *then* we receive money for it. Why? Because you want to share!

Take-what-you-want compensation means the staff of the organization—its proprietors, employees, contractors, etc.—directly determine their own compensation. No-one decides anyone else's salary, whether through performance reviews or other algorithmic determinations. Why? Because sharing is great! :-)

### Other Definitions

From http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Organization:

> An open organisation is an organisation open to anyone who agrees to abide by its purpose and principles, with complete transparency and clearly defined decision making structures, ownership patterns, and exchange mechanisms; designed, defined, and refined, by all members as part of a continual transformative process. (Source: http://uniteddiversity.com)

That one [seems](http://www.transitiontownbrixton.org/2009/12/definition-of-an-open-organisation/) to date to December, 2009—almost as old as E!

> An Open Organization is defined as the sharing of ideas, knowledge, resources, and skills across organizational, generational and cultural boundaries within, and in some cases outside, a flat hierarchical, agile, self-led organizational system for the purpose of achieving a stated outcome. (Source: Dr. Philip A Foster, http://www.maximumchange.com)

From [*The Open Organization*](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-organization) by RedHat CEO Jim Whitehurst (p. 2):

> [An open organization is] an organization that engages participative communities both inside and out[.]

No idea where [this](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/organic-organization.html) is coming from:

> Organizational structure characterized by (1) Flatness: communications and interactions are horizontal, (2) Low specialization: knowledge resides wherever it is most useful, and (3) Decentralization: great deal of formal and informal participation in decision making. Organic organizations are comparatively more complex and harder to form, but are highly adaptable, flexible, and more suitable where external environment is rapidly changing and is unpredictable. Also called open organizations, they are contrasted with mechanistic organizations.
