Before we get into practical matters, though, let's take a moment to define what we mean by an open company, and why you might want to run one.

## What is an Open Organization?

Let's start by defining what we mean when we talk about open organizations. There may be other definitions, but this is Gratipay's. We'll look first at a snapshot, our definition of an open organization as it currently stands. Then we'll provide some background on how we arrived at this definition.

### Our Definition

There are three characteristics we look for in an open organization: liberal licensing, pay-what-you-want revenue, and take-what-you-want compensation.

Liberal licensing means that your organization offers its products and services under liberal licenses such as those developed by [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) or approved by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/).
