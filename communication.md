# Communication

Organizations according to our definition are economic units larger than an individual, and whenever two or more people get together, they need to communicate. This is where *open* organizations start to get interesting, because their primary characteristic is that they have a porous boundary between the inside and the outside.

But also inside and outside, porous boundary.

Differentiating roles (gets into Governance?).
