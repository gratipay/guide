# Communication

Organizations are economic units larger than an individual, and whenever two or more people get together, they need to communicate. This is where *open* organizations start to get interesting, because their primary characteristic is that they have a permeable and fuzzy boundary between the inside and the outside. In closed organizations, where the boundary between inside and out is relatively firm and impermeable, there is a fairly strict separation between external communications (marketing, public relations) and internal communications.

But also inside and outside, porous boundary.

Differentiating roles (gets into Governance?).
