# Financing

It takes money to make money. How do you get started? How fast do you want to grow? Why?

## Bootstrapping

Whatever your business model, it will provide sustainable profit by definition (if not, your organization dies). Bootstrapping means only financing growth through your own profit. This is hard work. It's slow but rewarding.

## Outside Money

If you want to grow faster than your own profit allows, then you need to bring in outside money. The way this works is that someone gives you a big chunk of money now, in return for something later. The options available here are tied to your governance structure.

### Loans

You can get some people to give you money now if you promise to pay it back to them later. Friends, family, and sites such as [Kiva Zip](https://zip.kiva.org/) may loan you money at zero interest, if they like you enough. Banks, credit unions, and crowdfunding options like [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com/) and [Prosper](https://www.prosper.com/) may loan you money if you can convince them that you will pay it back with interest.

### Grants

Individuals can consider fellowships: Ashoka, Shuttleworth, Ph.D. programs.

Organizations can consider asking for donations from foundations or individuals. This could count as crowdfunding. Usually you'll structure as a non-profit. The key here is that people are giving you money because of value you give a third party. The people giving you money aren't getting the value (they get indirect social value).


### Investments

Capitalists will give you money if you can convince them that there's a 10% chance that you will give them ten times as much back within 10 years.
