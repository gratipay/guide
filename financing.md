## Bootstrapping

Whatever your business model, it will provide sustainable profit by definition (if not, your organization dies). Bootstrapping means only growing profit 

## Outside Money

If you want to grow faster than your own profit allows, then you need to bring in outside money. The way this works is that someone gives you a big chunk of money now, in return for something later. The options available here are tied to your governance structure.
