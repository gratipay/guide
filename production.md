Now the fun part: actually getting work done!

Different specialties have different comfort levels with working in an open organization. Software developers are familiar with open-source, so that's not usually the bottleneck. But even a software organization needs many more skills to succeed: design, QA, devops, customer service, accounting, HR, management, etc. And that's to say nothing of other types of organizations. Open organizations need not be software companies.

Don't be afraid to hire other companies, including closed ones, to do work that you are having trouble bringing in-house. Finding a good lawyer or CPA to work with is a great investment.
